    <h3>The fate of reading in print</h3>
    <p>Students, teachers, and parents have long deplored the rising costs of textbooks--today, a textbook in the sciences can cost hundreds of dollars, and overall, the prices of textbooks have been growing "faster than the prices of housing, cars, even health care" (NPR). Students are responding to these rising costs by purchasing used, renting, or sharing--and sometimes by not equipping themselves with the textbook, period. A 2014 survey by the US Public Interest Research Group revealed that 65% of students have elected not to purchase a textbook, despite worry that it would negatively impact their grades. While the US PIRG report, like many such studies, focus primarily on textbooks in mathematics and science-related fields, the ongoing sense of a "crisis" in the humanities is not isolated from these economic factors and larger cultural concerns about publishing and academic practice. Indeed, many humanities disciplines eschew the use of textbooks and emphasize the kind of long-form active reading that is unsuitable for digital environments. Naomi S. Baron argues that perhaps the <em>way</em> students are, increasingly, reading is in fact part of the reason for the decline in humanistic inquiry, because humanistic inquiry relies on deep, engaged reading and rereading, the kind of reading that is undermined in some respects by digital delivery. Baron concludes <a href="http://chronicle.com/article/How-E-Reading-Threatens/147661/">her essay in <i>The Chronicle of Higher Education</i> online</a> by saying, "We need to think more carefully about studentsâ€™ mounting rejection of long-form reading, now intensified by digital technologies that further complicate our struggle to engage students in serious text-based inquiry." Students resist purchasing textbooks; however, physical interaction with the page is one of the things that enables the deep reading and rereading required of the humanities. Students also often elect not to purchase print materials in favor of free and often invisibly- and problematically-edited materials that are easily google-able, and as many scholars (and teachers) have found, students often, and in large numbers, elect not to complete assigned readings (see the research on the unfortunately-termed "reading non-compliance"), sometimes becuase of a perceived lack of <a href="http://orgs.bloomu.edu/tale/documents/reading_sappington_twostudies.pdf">causal
connection between preparation and performance" (272)</a>. The US PIRG report suggests open textbooks as an alternative to costly and disincentivizing texts, but open textbooks don't necessaryily address the psychological disconnect between preparation and performance. Nor does it address the findings of Brost and Bradley about reading in advanced, elective courses: <a href="http://files.eric.ed.gov/fulltext/EJ854930.pdf">As a group, they did not complete the class reading even as they expressed very positive attitudes toward reading. Open-ended student responses suggested that many made a conscious decision not to read the assigned texts and there was some evidence that students did not view the reading as important to the pedagogical process" (106)</a>. Baier, et. al. puts it simply: <a href="http://www.americanreadingforum.org/yearbook/11_yearbook/documents/BAIER%20ET%20AL%20PAPER.pdf">students are increasingly reading less and less" (np)</a>. What faculty do about this situation--and their own roles in perpetuating it--is many-faceted, and there is no one answer. Some faculty are shrinking their reqiuired reading in an attempt to encourage <em>some</em> reading; but this does not always work as students expect, for Cliff's Notes cannot substitute. However, they are seen as interchangeable by readers approaching the material from a static understanding of factual information; the plot of <i>Paradise Lost</i> is basically the same whether I read about it in Wikipedia or trudge through the 10 (or 12) books of difficult Miltonic verse, so why would I trudge through 10 (or 12) books of difficult Miltonic verse? Some turn to quizzes, homework activities involving the reading, and so on; some turn to the wild-wild-web; others refocus on materiality, on physical engagement with the text, the kind of active reading that is also making. For instance, Ben Knights and Chris Thurgar-Dawson argue in <i>Active Reading: Transformative Writing in Literary Studies</i> that the discipline of English studies should be reconfigured under the capacious rubric of textual production. <a href="http://books.google.com/books?id=8MjiVCD4b4kC">[T]he conventional critical/creative binary divde," they write, "is profoundly unstable. That reading, critique, re-imagining, even doing literary criticism are themselves already forms of re-making..." (np)</a>.</p>
    <p>In the humanities, having access, as a class, to a good edition of a poem or a novel or a play is essential for deep reading; this must be something we can interact with, go back to, annotate, and so on. Additionally, that edition must be common to all, as every teacher knows. How do you point to a line or a page if everyone has a different edition? The digital world exacerbates this basic problem.  Print, it seems, is the best solution in the humanities. I agree with Baron--we do need to think carefully and critically about the fate of long-form reading in a digital environment. However, it is also unlikely that we will ever read <i>more</i> in print than we currently do. The question is, how can we make enable deep reading in digital platforms? This is a question that plagues everyone.</p>
    <h3>Not textbooks, but full-text</h3>
    <p>Yet, an additional problem faces small colleges and universities that lack access to the variety of proprietary electronic materials or physical special collections that enhance active learning and inquiry, the kind of pedagogy that is increasingly demanded of faculty. ECCO, NCCO, Burney Collections, and similar repositories are typically not available at community colleges and smaller universities, nor are they available at schools focusing on professional degrees. </p>
