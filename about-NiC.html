    <h1>About the Project</h1>
    <p>The goal of the Novels in Context project is to provide curated,
    scholarly, and critically-annotated resources about the 18th-century English novel for scholars,
    teachers, and students. </p>
    <h3>The Fate of Reading in Print</h3>
    <p>In the humanities, having access, as a
    class, to a good edition of a poem or a novel or a play is essential for deep reading; this must
    be something we can interact with, go back to, annotate, and so on. Additionally, that edition
    must be common to all, as every teacher knows. How do you point to a line or a page if everyone
    has a different edition? The digital world exacerbates this basic problem. Print, it seems, is
    the best solution in the humanities; however, it is also unlikely that we will ever read more in
    print than we currently do. As many scholars and commentators have pointed out, we need to think
    carefully and critically about the fate of long-form reading in a digital environment. The
    question is, how can we make enable deep reading in digital platforms? This is a question that
    plagues everyone. </p>
    <h3>Not textbooks, but full-text</h3>
    <p>An additional problem faces small colleges and universities that lack access to the
        variety of proprietary electronic materials or physical special collections that enhance
        active learning and inquiry, the kind of pedagogy that is increasingly demanded of faculty.
        ECCO, NCCO, Burney Collections, and similar repositories are typically not available at
        community colleges and smaller universities, nor are they available at schools focusing on
        professional degrees. Textual annotating tools differ dramatically from user to user, computer to computer; similarly, institutions experience great difficulty keeping up with the variety of platforms and tools that individual students or faculty might use. While MIT's <a href="http://www.annotationstudio.org/">Annotation Studio</a> project is working to rectify this problem for students, the problem persists in the textbook industry, primarily because of its for-profit nature.</p>
    <h3>Teaching Textual Production</h3>
    <p>The goal of the Novels in Context project is to provide curated, scholarly, and critically-annotated resources about the 18th-century English novel for teachers, scholars, and students. However, beyond merely providing these resources on the web, NiC also seeks to incorporate student- and faculty-authored resources in reliable and persistent forms.</p>
    <p>As a teaching tool, NiC will grow into a model for creating coursepacks with curated and annotated digital objects, with headnotes and reading questions, that have a digital home but which can also easily be exported into organized print documents for student use. Further, NiC will offer teachers interested in collaborating on the project a way to introduce students to digital humanities in a highly structured manner that will become useful beyond the classroom and to other teachers, scholars, and students. And finally, as a collection of resources particularly focused on the material life of the printed object as it is reproduced both in print and in the digital realm, NiC hopes to make transparent the limits of textual fungibility, especially problematic in contemporary reading experiences. How can we attend to the differences, in purpose, nature, and quality, between online texts, modern print editions, early printed editions, and so on? While this version of the project focuses on the 18th-century English novel, it can contain any combination of content; as such, it may provide a useful alternative to costly print anthologies that sustain traditional models of canonicity, scholarship, and authorship.</p>
    <p>Many scholars have shown that active learning--especially the new concept of critical making--is essential to create the sense of student ownership that enables both retention and invested engagement with the material. NiC seeks to create a model whereby student labor in a digitally-enhanced classroom environment, and even student labor in digital humanities writ large, can become a full part of the public intellectual project, on par with the work done by faculty and scholars who produce new print editions of stand-alone or anthologized works. The challenge here, however, lies in providing a framework that allows student intellectual activity to become both an intellectual exercise in pursuit of subject knowledge or skills and more than an educational exercise limited to this classroom and this semester. NiC will address this problem by providing a narrow framework focused on descriptive interventions rather than interpretive interventionn: students work to learn about and render transparent the historical, material specificity of the object; to make educated choices about selecting content; and to identify and describe references to people, places, and things. Student-faculty research can become publicly productive through this new bibliographic mode.</p>

<!--    <p>Students, teachers, and parents have long deplored the rising costs of textbooks - today, a-->

<!--        science-related fields, the ongoing sense of a "crisis" in the humanities is not isolated-->
<!--        from these economic factors and larger cultural concerns about publishing and academic-->
<!--        practice. Indeed, many humanities disciplines eschew the use of textbooks and emphasize the-->
<!--        kind of long-form active reading that is unsuitable for digital environments. Naomi S. Baron-->
<!--        argues that perhaps the <em>way</em> students are, increasingly, reading is in fact part of-->

<!--                Chronicle of Higher Education</i> online</a> by saying, "We need to think more-->
<!--        carefully about studentsâ€™ mounting rejection of long-form reading, now intensified by-->
<!--        digital technologies that further complicate our struggle to engage students in serious-->
<!--        text-based inquiry." Students resist purchasing textbooks; however, physical interaction-->
<!--        with the page is one of the things that enables the deep reading and rereading required of-->
<!--        the humanities. Students also often elect not to purchase print materials in favor of free-->
<!--        and often invisibly- and problematically-edited materials that are easily google-able, and-->
<!--        as many scholars (and teachers) have found, students often, and in large numbers, elect not-->
<!--        to complete assigned readings (see the research on the unfortunately-termed "reading-->

<!--            connection between preparation and performance" (272)</a>. The US PIRG report suggests-->
<!--        open textbooks as an alternative to costly and disincentivizing texts, but open textbooks-->
<!--        don't necessaryily address the psychological disconnect between preparation and performance.-->
<!--        Nor does it address the findings of Brost and Bradley about reading in advanced, elective-->
